DE2_70_Synthesizer
------

This demonstration shows how to implement a Multi-tone Electronic Keyboard using DE2-70 board with a PS/2 Keyboard and a speaker.

Running the Design
------------------

1) Connect a PS/2 Keyboard to the DE2-70 board
2) Connect the VGA output of the DE2-70 board to a VGA monitor (both LCD and CRT type of monitors should work)
3) Connect the Lineout of the DE2-70 board to a speaker.
4) Launch the Quartus II software.
5) Open the DE2_70_Synthesizer.qpf project located in the <install path>\DE2_70_Synthesizer folder. (File menu -> Open Project)
6) Open the Programmer window. (Tools menu -> Programmer)
7) The DE2_70_Synthesizer.sof programming file should be listed.
   Check the 'Program/Configure' box and set up the JTAG programming hardware connection via the 'Hardware Setup' button.
8) Press 'Start' to start programming. The design should now be programmed and running.
